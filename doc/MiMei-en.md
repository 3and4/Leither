### Summary
A trend of internet in the past few decades is the fast concentration of traffics on fewer apps or sites owned by tech giants, who used their dominant control of data to influence, even manipulate user behavior for monopolistic profits, at the expense of average users. However, we hold the following truth to be self-evident, that a free and open internet is of the best interest to its users.

Leither, a decentralized Cloud OS, is designed to take the above challenge by decoupling and reconstructing most of the core services of regular internet in a decentralized fashion, therefore give the control of data back to user, its real owner. Leither OS has implemented all the subsystems necessary to reconstruct regular internet services, such as authentication and authorization, file system, database, application framework, domain name service and routing. Applications run on Leither platform provide a user experience consisted with that of the regular internet.

To match a regular internet application on Leither, such as Youtube or Google, simply creates a Leither organization and a Consensus Contract to stipulate how to contribute tokens among participants. Token is a proof of contribution that garantees proportional dividend of the organizaiton's income, or exchange for services such as traffics, routing, domian name resolution, search, backup, bandwidth, CPU power, contract notary, or mining pledge.

Members of an organization include initiater, investor, developer, content or service provider, device owner, operation and marketing, etc. The distribution of income is garanteed by Consensus. Device owner does the work of miner in BTC. Devices keep the books as mining machines in BTC, at the same time provide more valuable business services of the organization. Compared with POW-based block-chain Leither block-chain has advantages in every aspect of cost, efficiency, performance and privacy, and last but not least, law abiding.

The whole paper is divided into 2 parts:
Part I: Introduction of MiMei and its application system. How to reconstruct regular internet platform.
Part II: Organization and consensus. How to coordinate interests of participants and expand organization.

### Part I MiMei and its application
Some key concepts are defined as below:

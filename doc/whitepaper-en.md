Decentered network and its application in smart contract
========
### Introduction
An alarming trend of internet in the past few decades is the fast concentration of traffics on fewer apps or sites owned by tech giants, who used their dominant control of data to influence, even manipulate user behavior for monopolistic profits, at the expense of average users. However, we hold the following truth to be self-evident, that a free and open internet is of the best interest to its users.

Leither, a decentralized Cloud OS, is designed to take the challenge by decoupling and reconstructing most of the core services of regular internet in a decentralized fashion, and give the control of data back to user, its real owner. Leither OS has implemented all the subsystems necessary to reconstruct regular internet services, such as authentication and authorization, file system, database, application framework, domain name service and routing.

The user experience in Leither system is compatible with regular internet, but Leither has the following advantages.
+ Easy application development
+ Extremely low requirement of system resources
+ Low cost of bandwidth
+ Simple implement of elastic services

To reconstruct a regular internet application, for example Youtube or Google, simply creates a Leither Organization and a Smart Contract to stipulate how to distribute tokens among participants. Token is a proof of contribution that guarantees proportional dividends of the organization's income, or can exchange for services such as traffics, routing, domain name resolution, search, backup, bandwidth, CPU power, contract notary, or mining pledge.

Members of an organization include founder, investor, developer, content or service provider, device operator, operation and marketing, etc. The distribution of income is guaranteed by consensus. Device owner does the work of miner in BTC. Devices keep the books as mining machines in BTC, at the same time provide more valuable business services of the organization. Compared with POW-based block-chain, Leither has advantages in all aspects of cost, efficiency, performance and privacy, and last but not least, law abiding.
